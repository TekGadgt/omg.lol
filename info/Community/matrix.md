# Matrix

Matrix is <a href="https://matrix.org">an open network for secure, decentralised communication</a>. It’s a really nice chat protocol based on a federation model, and there are <a href="https://matrix.org/ecosystem/clients/">a number of clients</a> available.

We run our own homeserver, which lives at matrix.omg.lol (but accounts use the omg.lol hostname). You can have an account on our homeserver, or use an existing account on another server. We have an omg.lol “space” with a bunch of rooms (see below), all of which are bridged to our IRC and Discord servers.

### Getting Started

To join, visit your address’s social.lol page. In the Matrix section, you’ll see two options: you can create a Matrix account on our homeserver for your omg.lol address, or you can invite your existing account from another instance to the omg.lol space. Click whichever button you wish, wait a couple of moments, and you’ll be good to go.

### Connecting

To use Matrix, you need a [clients](https://matrix.org/ecosystem/clients). You might try a few different ones until you land on one that you enjoy.

When connecting to our homeserver, be sure to use the address `matrix.omg.lol`. Your address will be `@username:omg.lol`, but if you enter `omg.lol` your client probably won’t be able to find the server (since it technically lives at `matrix.omg.lol`).

You can see the full list of [chat channels](/info/chat), all of which are bridged across our other chat services. You can also create your own channels too, if you’d like!
