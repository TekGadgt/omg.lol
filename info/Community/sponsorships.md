# Sponsorships

omg.lol is a community of and for people who love the web. If you’re black or brown, disabled, homeless, LGBTQ+, a senior citizen, or a member of *any* marginalized group (there are too many to name), you are welcome in the omg.lol community. There’s a home for you here. ❤️

If you’re a member of a marginalized group and can’t afford our annual fee, it’s no problem—thanks to [these generous people](http://home.omg.lol/sponsors) who have provided sponsored addresses.

Just send an email to <help@omg.lol>, let us know about your situation, and we’ll take care of you from there. 👍
