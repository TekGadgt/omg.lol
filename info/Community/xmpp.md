# XMPP

The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) started life as **Jabber**, an open protocol for instant messaging. It became a wildly popular protocol in the early days of the web, used by all kinds of different clients. It’s still widely supported today!

As part of your omg.lol [chat service](/info/chat), you have access to our XMPP server. Cool!

## Getting started

To kick things off, just visit your address’s social.lol page (look for the button that says “socialize, lol”). You’ll see a button you can click on there to get up and running with XMPP access.

Once you have your password, you can use an [XMPP client](https://xmpp.org/software/) to sign into the server and chat with other omg.lol members (and anyone else on the internet!) through omg.lol’s XMPP server.

## Group Rooms / Channels

Our XMPP Multi-User Chat (MUC) address is `conference.omg.lol`, so, for example, if you want to join our bridged #general channel, you’d connect to `general@conference.omg.lol`.

You can see the full list of [chat channels](/info/chat), all of which are bridged across our other chat services. You can also create your own channels too, if you’d like!
