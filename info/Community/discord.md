# Discord
Discord is a social platform that allows communication via VoIP and Instant Messaging. 

### Getting Started

To kick things off, visit your address’s social.lol page and then click the "Join Discord" button. You'll be able to connect your Discord account, and you'll be added to the server.

### Rules

Use common sense when chatting with others. Prioritize kindness. Show compassion. Remember that all omg.lol policies apply on irc.social.lol, like our [Code of Conduct](/info/code-of-conduct), [Terms of Use](/info/legal), and [Acceptable Use](/info/legal) policies. Just [don’t be an asshole](https://asshole.fyi) and you should be fine.


### IRC

The channels in Discord have a connection back to the omg.lol IRC server. Both services are bridged this way, and allows for our community to be connected regardless of which platform you prefer.

### Channels

Here are some of the popular channels on the server:

  * **#general**, general chatter about anything
  * **#random**, random or off-the-wall stuff
  * **#help**, customer service and support
  * **#omg.lol**, chat about omg.lol services
  * **#web**, web development stuff
  * **#email**, all about email
  * **#dns**, for the nerds
  * **#mastodon**, discuss Mastodon (social.lol or in general)
  * **#firehose**, notices, announcements, inbound webhooks, and other noisy (but interesting) stuff
