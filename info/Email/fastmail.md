# omg.lol & Fastmail

We’re really into email, and we deeply value privacy. So, naturally, we absolutely love [Fastmail](http://fastmail.com/omglol/). Fastmail is what we use for our personal email—for nearly a decade now!—and it’s so easy to recommend because it’s _that_ good.

With Fastmail, you can take your omg.lol service to the next level and actually **send email** from your @omg.lol email address. It only takes a few seconds to set up, and you’ll get fully hosted email that’s private, reliable, and, yes, _fast_. Check out [the full list of features](https://www.fastmail.com/omglol/#pricing) to see everything you get and pricing.

(Also, because you’re awesome, you’ll get 10% off your first year. But don’t sign up for the discount; sign up because your privacy matters and you deserve the best email service out there.)

## Setup

Fastmail customers enjoy the amazing perk of being able to send email from their omg.lol addresses. It’s so much fun.

If you’re not already a Fastmail customer, you can [fix that in mere seconds](http://fastmail.com/omglol/). If you’re already enjoying their service, read on to learn how to get things up and running. (It looks like a lot of steps, but it’s just a few clicks!)

### First: Point your omg.lol email to Fastmail

1. From your [omg.lol Dashboard](/dashboard), click on your address.
2. Then click **Manage Forwarding** and set your forwarding address to your Fastmail address.
3. Click the **Update** button and that’s that.

### Then: Add your omg.lol email address to Fastmail

In Fastmail, add your omg.lol email address from the **Settings → Migration** screen.

1. Click **Settings**, and then click **My email addresses**.
2. Click **Add address**, and then **Add an address you already own**.
3. In the Email field, enter your full omg.lol email address (e.g. foobar@omg.lol) and click **Next**.
4. Set your delivery preferences (if any), and adjust your name and signature as desired, and click **Save**.
5. Locate the email address you just added in the list. It should say "Unverified" beside it. Click the **Fix it** button.
6. Ignore the warning about not being able to send messages, and click the **Verify** button. Then click the **Send verification code** button.
7. You’ll receive a code via email within a second or two; place that code in the field and click **Verify**. You’ll then be ready to send email from the address!

And with that, you’re good to go! On the **My email addresses** screen in Fastmail, you can select your desired default “From” address that you’d like to use for outgoing email. (You can also choose from any of your favorite addresses on an individual basis when composing an email.)
